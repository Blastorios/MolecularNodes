Blender will freeze for potentially a minute or so during installation. Currently M1 / M2 macs require more complex installation to install MDAnalysis, please see the instructions below.

The good thing however is that these selections can always be updated and tweaked. They can even be created procedurally based on the values of other selections or animations.\nIn the example video below we are using the selection to apply the Atoms style. We can change the residues and chains that are selected by ticking and unticking the boxes. Each of these selections also take a field input, so they can use the output of other selection nodes. The selections from the two nodes are being combined with the Boolean Math node set to And. Other boolean math operations are also available.\nVideo"

The two rendering engines that come pre-installed are Eevee and Cycles. By default Eevee is enabled, but you can change to Cycles in the Render Properties tab.\nEevee is much faster and more responsive than Cycles, but a lot of the time doesn’t ‘look as nice’. Eevee is a real-time rendering engine built for performance and interactivity, while Cycles is a path-traced rendering engine built for physically accurate light calculations. This is much slower to calculate but often results in ‘nicer’ lighting. Both rendering engines are excellent and are helpful in different scenarios depending on the desired outcomes.\nThe default style Atoms Cycles inside of Molecular Nodes is only visible inside of Cycles for performance reasons. All other styles are visible inside of both rendering engines. If your atoms seem to be invisible, check the rendering engine and style that you are using.\n\nIf you have the option available, ensure to switch to GPU Compute instead of CPU when using the Cycles render engine.

In this example we will just add a material to the monkey to make it red, and a different material to the cube to make it blue.\n\nIf you can’t see the colors changing, ensure you are in Rendered view.\n\nIn the example below, we create a new material called Material.001 for the monkey which we change to red. The cube already has a material called Material.

    "text": "Changing Styles\nThe protein is now imported in the scene. To change the way the protein is displayed, we have to use the Geometry Nodes editor. This is where we change the nodes that are use to process the underlying atomic data, resulting in the final 3D object we can see in front of us.\nTo access Geometry Nodes panel, we can either select the Geoemtry Nodes workspace, or split the current viewport and change one of the workspaces into the node editor.\n\n\nVideo\nArranging workspaces.\n\n\nYou can change the workspace through the tabs in the top of Blender. You can split workspaces by hovering over the corner of a workspace, and then clicking and dragging. You can merge to workspaces by clicking and dragging from one into another, while dragging into the same workspace will split it and create two workspaces.\n\n\nVideo\nOpening the Geometry Nodes workspaces.\n\n\nGeometry node trees are explained more in the next section.\nIn short, the atomic data comes through the Group Input on the left, and the final 3D model goes out the Group Output to the right. Each node in between performs some actions on the data. The first node changes the colours of the atoms. The last node applies the given style. When importing we chose the Cartoon style default, so we have a cartoon node.\nWe can add a new node through the Add menu, or we can use Shift + A to add new nodes. We can click and drag on the noodle outputs and inputs to remove and create new connections. Notice how when the complete ‘circuit’ or ‘flow diagram’ goes through the ball and stick node, the style changes to ball and stick. When it flows through the cartoon node, the style changes to cartoon.\n\n\nVideo\nAdding a new node to change the output style."

    "text": "Geometry Nodes Editor\nThis is where we edit the node graph for Molecular Nodes. The node graph is a geometry processing program you create, that is read and executed by Blender from left to right. Each node performs an action on the geometry that is passed into it, and the result of that action is passed out to the right. Think of it as creating a set of rules for the computer to follow. You define the rules, and the computer can follow those same rules, even if you start with a different data set.\nThe data flows like a river, along the green noodles of the node graph. There must be only 1 final output. If you are using the molecular data, then there must also be a single input.\n\n\n\nExample node tree, demonstrating the flow of information through the nodes.\n\n\nThe data flows from left to right, like water through a river.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n  B --&gt; D(Style)\n  D --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Geometry Nodes workspace.\n\n\nThe starting style MOL_style_atoms_cycles is only visible via inside of the Cycles render engine. You can add other styles manipulate the data through other nodes, by adding them with Shift + A and navigating to the MolecularNodes panel at the bottom. There are several categories of nodes for different animations and styles. You can add the Ribbon Protein node, which will create a ribbon representation based on the alpha carbons in the structure. If there is not colour in the structure, ensure that the node has a material MOL_atomic_material at the bottom of the node.\n\nThe data flows through the node graph from left to right. There should always be one input, which is the atomic data that is stored in the 3D mesh of the atoms and bonds. There should also be only one output, which is the final geometry that has been created throughout the node graph.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n\n  B --&gt; D(Style 1)\n  B --&gt; E(Style 2)\n  B --&gt; S(Style 3)\n\n  sS[Selection] --&gt; S\n\n  E --&gt; F[Join\\nGeometry]\n  D --&gt; F\n  S --&gt; F\n\n  F --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the diagram, the flow of the data can split across multiple different branches of the tree, with the result of each parallel computation being combined before being exported.\nEach of these different branches can be a different style, in this example shown two different styles are applied, and the third style has a custom selection. All of the styles are the result of the same data manipulation.\nThe node graph in between can be as complex as you want to make it, as long as there is a continuous connection to the output of the geometry, it should produce a result.\n\n\n\nAn example of a more complex node graph, with multiple branches that diverge and come back together.\n\n\nCombining multiple different nodes you can create protein models and complex 3D scenes. In the example below, there is a node tree which should be present on every new structure imported via MolecularNodes. The atoms and bonds are passed in from the left, the atoms are given a colour based on their element and their chain_id, and then the atoms are styled as atoms, scaling the atom radii to 1.00.\nThe data flows through the node tree from left to right, along the bright green lines. The atomic data comes in, goes through layers of manipulation, a style is applied, and the created geometry is then outputted from the node tree.\n\nEditing the Styles\nTo change how each style looks, you can edit the default values of the nodes. By changing the values, you change the numbers that are used in the creation of the 3D models. The style will only change if it is being output through the node tree. You can click and drag to change the values smoothly. You can hold Shift while dragging the values to change them more accurately.\n\n\nVideo\nTweaking the default values of the styles."

    "text": "Combining Styles\nTo complete this tutorial, we will combine the use of Selection and Join Geometry to create a style which shows the side chains as ball and stick while also showing the cartoon style.\nThe style should usually be the last node that you apply to a model. You can’t apply a style after another style, as the output of a style is 3D geometry and not ‘atom-like’ geometry. Instead, we can combine two styles with a Join Geometry node. That way, we create both styles in parallel and then join them together before outputting them all through the Group Output node.\nThe node can be found under Geometry or by going through the search for Join Geometry\n\n\nVideo\nAdding a Join Geometry node."

    "text": "Selections\nMany nodes will have a Selection input, which you can’t manually edit. This input is a Boolean attribute and says whether or not to apply an operation to atoms based on if the value is True or False.\nYou can use selections via the Molecular Nodes -&gt; Selection menu. In this example we use the Backbone node to select atoms based on if they are part of the backbone, the side chain, or just alpha carbons.\nYou can see as we connect different outputs from the Backbone node, we get different results in the final style.\n\n\nVideo\nChanging selections for the Ball and Stick style."
