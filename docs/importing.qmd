## PDB File

To download from the PDB, all that is required is the 4-character PDB code.

Input the PDB code, then click <kdb>Download</kbd>. Molecular Nodes will download and import 
the structure into Blender. A starting node tree based on the selected `Style` will be created.

## Local File

A structure from your computer can be opened win thte `Local File` tab. You can choose a starting style and the name of the molecule when imported.

## CellPack

To import a CellPack dataset, you can use a `.cif` of `.bcif` formatted file.

Molecular Nodes will import each of the individual structures contained in the file, into their own collection inside of the `MN_data` collection.

The instanced structure will be created, which will use the import structures and the underlying instancing information to recreate the overall structure.

The imported model will initial display as a point cloud. This is for performance reasons, as the fully instanced model can be very slow on some computers, with the potential to crash Blender. You can untick the `As Points` option to change it over to the instances of the atomic chains.

The `Fraction` input what proption of the instances are shown. Again this can be used for performance reasons, to reduce the number of instances shown until render time when all are shown.
